## Cricket Shot Classification

Me and my teammate collaborated together and developed a real-time cricket shot classification system by converting video audio into spectrograms to pinpoint high-amplitude peaks and extract the corresponding key frames. Those frames are processed with Detectron2 pose estimation to pull out skeletal keypoints, which a convolutional neural network then uses to accurately classify each shot type.
